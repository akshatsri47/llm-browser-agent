  ## TASK
  
  ### 1. LOGIN
  ```
  Navigate to linkedin.com
  Wait for page to load (3s)
  Look for and click "Sign in" button
  Enter credentials:
    - Email: {email} in first input field
    - Password: {password} in second input field

  Find search field and enter {job_query}
  Press Enter to search
  Wait for search results (5s)

  ```
  For each job listing:
    EXTRACT and REMEMBER job title and company name
    Click on job listing to view details

    Check if "Easy Apply" button exists
       If "Easy Apply" exists:
